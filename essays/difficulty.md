*Persistence: the fact of continuing in an opinion or course of action despite difficulty or opposition.*  

I never imagined that pursuing a **Computer Science degree** would be as tough as it has been. When I started, I knew it wouldn’t be easy, but I didn’t expect to **fail, struggle, and even question whether I should quit**. Yet, through all the difficulties, I have **kept moving forward**, and that, more than anything, has defined my journey.  

## **Freshman Year – A Rough Start**  

My introduction to programming began in **ICS 111 - Introduction to Computer Science I** with **Scott Robertson**. Learning **Java** for the first time felt overwhelming but also exciting. By the end of the semester, I finally understood how a computer program worked, and I felt like I had taken my first step toward becoming a programmer.  

Then came **ICS 211 - Introduction to Computer Science II** with **Edo Biagioni**, and everything changed. The assignments were tough, recursion confused me, and my **first real challenge in CS hit me hard**. I did everything I could—studied, practiced, asked for help—but I still ended up with a **D**. It was a wake-up call.  

## **Sophomore Year – Almost Giving Up**  

Since I needed **ICS 211** to move forward, I had to **retake the class**. I thought that since I had seen the material before, I would do better. But the opposite happened—I failed again.  

At that point, I started questioning everything. **Was I just not meant for computer science? Was I wasting my time?** Seeing my classmates move on while I was stuck on the same class twice was frustrating. I seriously considered quitting.  

Before making that decision, I explored other options and found that **Kapi‘olani Community College (KCC) offered ICS 211** as well. The structure was different, the pacing was more manageable, and with a new approach, I **finally understood the concepts I had struggled with for so long**. This time, I **passed with a B**.  

That moment changed my perspective. I realized that **failure doesn’t mean you can’t succeed—it just means you haven’t found the right way to learn yet**.  

## **Junior Year – A New Level of Challenge**  

Having finally passed ICS 211, I could **move forward in my CS degree**. In my **first semester of junior year**, I took **ICS 311 - Algorithms** with **Brook Conner**. The fact that the class was **online** made it more manageable, but the content itself was brutal.  

Algorithms **completely changed how I thought about programming**. I had to analyze problems deeply, optimize solutions, and understand **time complexity**. Concepts like **graph theory, dynamic programming, and NP-completeness** made me feel like a beginner all over again. There were many nights where I felt stuck, staring at problems for hours, unsure of how to even start. But despite the struggles, I **passed**.  

Now, in my **second semester of junior year**, I’m taking **ICS 314 - Software Engineering I**. It’s less theoretical than Algorithms but **challenges me in a different way**. Instead of solving problems alone, I’ve had to **work in teams, use GitHub, and follow Agile development practices**. It’s my first real exposure to **how software is built in the industry**, and while it’s tough, I can see why these skills matter.  

## **Why It Was All Worth It**  

If there’s one thing I’ve learned from my journey so far, it’s that **computer science is not about being the smartest person in the room—it’s about persistence**. I’ve failed, struggled, and almost given up, but I kept going.  

Some things will always be difficult, but that doesn’t mean they’re impossible. **I’ve learned to push through, find new ways to learn, and keep moving forward—even when it feels like I’m falling behind.**
