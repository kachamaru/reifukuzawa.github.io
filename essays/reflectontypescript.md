# Introduction  
So far, TypeScript has been an interesting ride. I had zero experience in JavaScript beforehand; learning them side by side presented some challenges along with the joys of doing something for the first time. It was amazing how TypeScript brings structured robustness into JavaScript to make it maintainable, scaled, and the go-to for large-scale software engineering projects.  

In the following essay, I will reflect on my experience with TypeScript, its comparison with other languages, its role regarding software engineering, and my reflection of athletic software engineering through practice WODs.  

## TypeScript versus JavaScript and Other Languages  
Since this is the first time that I've used JavaScript, learning TypeScript added some extra overhead in learning it. On the other hand, it made static typing in TypeScript let me understand structures of data and expectations of functions more clearly. Unlike JavaScript, which mostly allows type-related bugs to pass unnoticed until runtime, TypeScript catches those bugs at compile time. This makes it easier to debug and increases code readability.  

Compared to languages like Java and C++, TypeScript feels like a middle ground: It provides type safety while still maintaining the flexibility of JavaScript. Amongst everything, one thing I found particularly useful was TypeScript's type system advanced with union types and type inference, which can be helpful in making the code safer as well as more expressive.  

## Strengths and Weaknesses in Software Engineering  
TypeScript has the following advantages from a software engineering perspective:  

- **Better maintainability**: TypeScript has the capability to make codebases more maintainable as it scales, using extensive usage of type annotations and interfaces.  
- **Improved collaboration**: Teamwork is smoother because TypeScript will have clear expectations about the inputs and outputs of each function.  
- **Better tooling**: An IDE can offer better autocompletion, refactoring tools, and better error detection.  

Yet, TypeScript has several drawbacks:  

- **Learning curve**: Being a complete beginner, it was quite critical for me to learn JavaScript and TypeScript at the same time.  
- **Compilation step**: TypeScript, unlike JavaScript, requires compilation before running and hence is an additional development step.  

Despite these challenges, I still believe TypeScript is a net positive for most projects and especially projects that require a long-term maintenance phase.  

## Conclusion  
To summarize, personally, I do consider TypeScript a very nice language from the point of view of software engineering, and I am looking forward to working with it soon.  

## AI Usage  
I used AI as a kind of brainstorming tool and to help organize my thoughts, fine-tune the structure of my essay, but the actual content is based on my personal experience and point of view.
