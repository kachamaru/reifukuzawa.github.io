Fish Quest is a two-player fishing game where players compete to catch the largest fish over the course of one full season. With a variety of fish species, fishing methods, and seasonal regulations, players must carefully plan their strategy to maximize their success. Each decision matters, as fishing illegally can result in losing progress.  

## **How to Play**  
Players have **12 months** to catch the three largest fish they can. The game features **four different fish species**, each with specific requirements for legal fishing methods and active seasons. There are **five different fishing techniques**, and choosing the right method at the right time is crucial.  

However, players must follow the regulations in the **rulebook** to avoid penalties. Fishing outside of legal methods or seasons will result in setbacks, so careful planning and rule awareness are essential.

## **Strategic Tips for Success**
