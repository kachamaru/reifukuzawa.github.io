summary: "This project is a two-player fishing tournament game implemented in Java, built as part of a course assignment at Kapiʻolani Community College (ICS at KCC).

Fish over the course of one season! Fish Quest is a two-player game designed to let players compete over the best catches.
There are 4 different fish species and 5 possible fishing methods. Each species has it’s own specifications for catching methods and legal seasons so players have to be careful to avoid illegally fishing. So make sure to check your rulebook otherwise you’ll lose your progress! 
Players will only have 12 months to catch the three biggest fishes they can!
Don’t worry if things start a little slow, fishes grow bigger at the end of the month—so you can always catch up!
