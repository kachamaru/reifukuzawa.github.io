summary: "We developed an interactive VR visualization to explore U.S. unemployment data (1976-2022). The system uses color gradients to represent unemployment rates across all 50 states, allowing users to navigate through time with a dial interface and explore metrics via an interactive console. By leveraging VR’s immersive capabilities, the visualization enhances accessibility and reveals patterns that may be less apparent in traditional data representations."

# **Interactive VR Visualization of US Unemployment Data**  

## **Overview**  
We present an interactive **Virtual Reality (VR) visualization** designed to explore United States unemployment data from **1976 to 2022**. Our system represents all **50 US states**, using **color gradients** to depict varying unemployment rates over time.  

## **Features**  
- **Time Navigation** – Users can navigate through different years using a **dial interface**.  
- **Interactive Console** – Provides access to various unemployment metrics for deeper exploration.  
- **Regional Insights** – Highlights **patterns and trends** in unemployment across different states.  
- **Immersive VR Experience** – Enhances data exploration by allowing users to **interact with economic data in a more intuitive way**.  

## **Impact**  
By leveraging VR's **immersive capabilities**, our system makes complex unemployment data more accessible and enables users to **identify trends and regional impacts** that might be less apparent in traditional visualizations. This project **demonstrates the potential of VR for economic data analysis**, offering a novel approach to understanding historical unemployment patterns.
