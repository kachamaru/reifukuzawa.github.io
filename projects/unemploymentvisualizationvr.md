summary: "We developed an interactive VR visualization to explore U.S. unemployment data (1976-2022). The system uses color gradients to represent unemployment rates across all 50 states, allowing users to navigate through time with a dial interface and explore metrics via an interactive console. By leveraging VRâ€™s immersive capabilities, the visualization enhances accessibility and reveals patterns that may be less apparent in traditional data representations."

We present an interactive Virtual Reality (VR) visualization for exploring United States unemployment data from 1976 to 2022. Our system depicts the 50 US states, using color gradients to display unemployment rates. Users navigate through time using a dial interface and can explore various metrics through an interactive console. The visualization reveals valuable insights into unemployment patterns and its regional impacts. By leveraging VR's immersive capabilities, our visualization makes complex unemployment data more accessible and enables users to discover patterns that might be less apparent in traditional visualizations. The system demonstrates how VR can be effectively used to explore and understand historical economic data.
